# Call For Maintainers

This plugin, along with others like it, is now maintained by the
[HashiVim](http://hashivim.github.io/) organization, which is looking for
additional maintainers and contributors. See the HashiVim home page for
further information.

# vim-vaultproject

This plugin adds a `:Vault` command that runs [vault](http://vaultproject.io),
with tab completion of subcommands.

This plugin is called "vim-vaultproject" because "vault" is a very
generic term and I didn't want to squat on it.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/hashivim/vim-vaultproject.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
