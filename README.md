# vim-vaultproject

This plugin adds a `:Vault` command that runs [vault](http://vaultproject.io),
with tab completion of subcommands.

This plugin is called "vim-vaultproject" because "vault" is a very
generic term and I didn't want to squat on it.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/markcornick/vim-vaultproject.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
