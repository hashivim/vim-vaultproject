# Unmaintained

I'm no longer using Vim regularly, and am not updating my various Vim
plugins. Please contact me if you would like to take over maintenance
of any or all of them. Thanks!

# vim-vaultproject

This plugin adds a `:Vault` command that runs [vault](http://vaultproject.io),
with tab completion of subcommands.

This plugin is called "vim-vaultproject" because "vault" is a very
generic term and I didn't want to squat on it.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/markcornick/vim-vaultproject.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
