{"name":"vim-vaultproject","tagline":"basic vim/vault integration","body":"This plugin adds a `:Vault` command that runs [vault](http://vaultproject.io),\r\nwith tab completion of subcommands.\r\n\r\nThis plugin is called \"vim-vaultproject\" because \"vault\" is a very\r\ngeneric term and I didn't want to squat on it.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nWith [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:\r\n\r\n    cd ~/.vim/bundle\r\n    git clone https://github.com/hashivim/vim-vaultproject.git\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nOriginally written by Mark Cornick <https://www.markcornick.com/>.
